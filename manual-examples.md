# Manual Examples

Roughly speaking, an organization's manual helps you to understand:

- What an organization is / is about.
- Things you should know about the organization, both to fit in and be successful.
- Whether or not the organization's values align with your own.

They also tend to be a bit more detailed and concrete, as opposed to things like principles or core values.
