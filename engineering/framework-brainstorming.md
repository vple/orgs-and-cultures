# Framework Brainstorming

## Questions

- What does a career framework need to do?
- When is a career framework successful?
- How granular / specific does a framework have to be?
- How can you get an accurate-enough sense of how someone is doing? (Managers have blind spots.)
- Do you / how do you ensure cross-organization calibration? Are orgs incentivized to promote their people before they are ready?

## Misc Thoughts

- A good framework allows someone to understand what they need to do to get to the next tier.
- How do you handle different disciplines / concerns? When do these get split out, vs. having general guidelines? (Application engineer, security engineer, systems engineer, etc.)
- How do you tie in general technical development, org-specific culture, and business needs/goals?
- Sustainability (via Google)--you'll want to measure if people are writing sustainable code.
  - Growth dimension = complexity / size / scope. Writing a sustainable class/method is different from building a sustainable service.
  - Distinguish between "happens to be sustainable" and "is sustainable." It might be fine if a certain level contributes sustainable code, even if they haven't mastered sustainability at that level yet.
- What level of "product/service maturity" is someone being evaluated at, and does that match what they should be evaluated at?
  - Pioneer / Settler / Planner Model

    - Pioneers build new, experimental ideas. Planners build lasting organizations. Settlers transition between the two.
  - This is actually a continuum.
  - What role do you need someone to fill? Do they function as one role, or do they have to switch depending on the projects they are working on?
  - Does the framework accurately capture & incentivize the right things? Some of these roles have antagonistic objectives/principles.
- Tracks: Parallel/orthogonal dimensions that someone can develop in.
  - Some things make sense as tracks, such as ability to deliver a project vs. technical ability.
  - How do you normalize levels across different track shapes?
    - Can you substitute expertise in one track for expertise in another? To what extent?
    - Are there minimum/required proficiencies?
  - Do you want to establish archetypes?
- Spectrums: Differing roles / "operating frequencies" that someone can function as.
  - Example: product/service maturity (above). If someone is an exceptional pioneer, do you want to provide a path that allows them to continue being an exceptional pioneer? Do you care if they are a poor planner?
- Provide examples / stories.
