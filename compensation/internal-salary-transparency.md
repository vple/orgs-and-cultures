# Internal Salary Transparency

This doc is a proponent of:

- Making salary methodologies easily available and accessible to anyone in the company.
  - For example, if you use salary bands, all bands for all roles should be internally accessible.

This doc is against:

- Making individuals' salaries accessible to anyone other than the individual or the managerial chain. (Your peers shouldn't have access to your compensation.)

## Motivations

### Internally Accessible Salary Methodologies

- It's unclear what benefits are gained by keeping salary methodology secret.
- Providing this info helps people make more informed decisions.
  - This should help reduce speculation around: "Am I being over/underpaid?"

### Confidential Individual Compensation

- It's no one's business, other than the individual.

## Challenges & Concerns

### Fairness

This is complicated, as with anything involving the word "fair."

#### By Cohort / Demographics

At a minimum, actual compensation should be fair (meaning monetarily equal) acrosss cohorts/demographics.

The only exception should be if the compensation structure was intentionally designed to differ between two groups.
However, it's very important that this was intentionally done (as opposed to backwards-justification for the state you ended up in).

There should be a safeguard to monitor for this. 
Periodically, per cohort/demographic, crunch the numbers and compare them.
If they don't line up, dig into it.

Addressing inequal situations should involve two parts: short-term and long-term.

Short-term is fixing the unfair situation for the affected people.
This is akin to saying you're not sure how/why things ended up this way, but you're assuming that you screwed up somehow.
As a result, you're going to [e.g., raise someone's salary] in order to immediately fix the short term problem.

This involves giving someone the benefit of the doubt.
If the women in the org are on average paid less, this means increasing everyone's compensation for the average to match the men's.

Long-term is figuring out the issue.
This involves looking for reasons / correlated data.

For example, if women are on average being paid less, is that because they are just given lower compensations?
Or could it be a consequence of spending longer periods of time at each level?
These are two different problems requiring two different solutions.

It's also important to track the long-term hypothesis over time (and to make that hypothesis in the first place).
Note that the metric here may not be the actual compensation numbers, such as with the second case above (women spending longer time at a level).

This is especially important since the short-term fix affects whether or not things seem unfair in the future.
The problem isn't necessarily fixed just because the money is equal.

#### Between Individuals

See also Sharing Compensation Info below.

The main concern here is that person X finds out about person Y's compensation, and this then makes person X unhappy.
In particular:

- Is the difference between X and Y "objectively" justified?
  - Is there a clear differentiator? Is it something the company will stand behind—would they put this in writing / back it in other scenarios as well?
- Does X perceive the difference as fair/justified?
  - Note that X may perceive this to be unfair even if the company does have a good justification.
- Based on the above, what are you going to do?

As ground expectations—if person X is _actively_ seeking out others' compensation information, they should understand that they may feel [jealous/disappointed/etc.].
Unless X is the absolute best in a role, it's likely that someone else is making more.

This is not to say that person X's feelings/impressions are necesssarily or automatically wrong.
This is saying that person X should be realistic/self-aware.

Next, a combination of clarifying conditions and reevaluating those conditions.
Compensation is affected by stuff, possibly including:

- time in role
- expertise / skillset
- performance

As long as it still protects individual confidentiality, these should be internally public.
The goal is for someone to be able to accurately understand the compensation difference, ideally being able to understand this on their own.
For example, it is good if person X understands that person Y is being paid less because they have spent 2 fewer years in the roll.

If there is still a perceived mismatch, person X should address it with their manager.

This conversation should be around making things fair for person X.
It is not:

- A person X vs person Y conversation.
- A place for the manager to justify why person Y is different than person X (outside of the publicly available knowledge, mentioned above).

Person X's concern should, preferably, be framed in one of two ways:

- Person X believes that [the company] does not know/recognize that they have [met criterion A] that would justify a higher compensation.
- Person X believes there may be some kind of systemic bias that they are being harmed by. This should be systemic, not based on individual (in)actions by person X.

It is okay for person Y to be brought up as a reference point / example, but it should not be an X vs Y situation.

In the first scenario:

- What criterion does person X believe they have?
- How was person X evaluated on this criterion?
  - This should not be a backwards justification.
  - It is okay (and good) for the manager to acknowledge that this may have been subjective/biased, if there isn't any factual/evaluatable evidence.
  - If it is believed that X was fairly evaluated, why didn't X know about this?
  - If it is believed that X may not have been fairly evaluated, how might X prove this?
- Address systemic concerns. In general, how is an arbitrary person Z evaluated on this criterion?
  - What constitutes evidence that someone has met this criterion?
  - When should person Z get the opportunities (i.e. when are they qualified) to demonstrate competency for this criterion?
  - Are all qualified persons getting this opportunity?

The second scenario is more complicated.
You'll have to determine how you can evaluate that claim.

### Sharing Compensation Info

Anyone should be free to share, or not share, their personal compensation.
That is their business.

It's important to make sure people don't feel pressured in either direction.

- The company shouldn't suggest that people keep their compensation private.
- Peers shouldn't pry. If someone doesn't want to share, stop asking.

Companies should assume that this will happen, to some degree.
